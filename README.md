# BooksBC

TODO

1:
display data from the book model on the home page
  - this will serve as the listings page (i would say priority 1)
  - allow each book to be selected and take you to a specific book page
  - in the specific book page allow for a message to be sent to the seller (message interface will itself be a task)
    - maybe we want to have messages handled at profile payge?
    - we might need to organize ourselves to decide how to hadle this task
  
 2:
 add a search feature to search the home page
  - when user enters information it will filter the book items and only display those that match the search field
    - we may at first only allow searching by title then add features like isbn or author or even course
    
 3:
 Create a profile page to display the information from the profile model
  - can be pretty simple
    - maybe we want to have a button here to send them a message?
   
    
 4:
 Create a page to hold any books that have been 'stared' or otherwise saved
  - sync with specific book logic
 
 5:
 create a message interface to allow users to message one another
 
 6:
 admin panel to moniter and observe all the data
    - not to sure how to go about this one but we might be able to leverage the pre-exising django admin console
 
 Continuous: (as we go along)
 style and make the whole deal look noice
